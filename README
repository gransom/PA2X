How to build:

- untar the tar-ball with tar -xvf somewhere
- in the current-mmddyy directory, run 'make base'

- To run the parser for the configuration ./config/config-2 :
  (in the current-mmddyy directory)

  run:  'make conf=./config/config-2'

- To build the examples, they are based onm ./config/config-2:

  run: 'make examples'   (example-3 is work in progress and
  basically the same as example-2)

- there is a checksum.c file, which will only compile if you have
  openssl-devel installed. If you don't have it installed you
  can safely ignore that, it has not been incorporated in the parser yet.

  example-1 shows how to access/change the config structure
  the parser way, if needed.
  example-2 shows how to access members of the config structure
  the 'regular C' way.

- 'make clean'    :   cleans everything except for the 'base'
- 'make pristine' :   clean everything as if you just untarred it
